# MudBlazor Ecommerce

This is a minimal Blazor Server application using MudBlazor components. The app starts on a login page and requires authentication before navigating to the product listing page.

Since the environment does not include the .NET SDK, the project files are provided as a template. You can build and run it locally with .NET 6 installed:

```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```
