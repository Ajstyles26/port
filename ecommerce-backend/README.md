# E-commerce Backend

This ASP.NET Core project provides a simple API for the demo e-commerce site.
The sample `Program.cs` exposes a `/api/products` endpoint returning an
in-memory list of items. Configure additional endpoints and database logic as
needed.

## Running

```bash
cd ecommerce-backend
dotnet run
```

The API will listen on `https://localhost:5001` by default when run locally.
